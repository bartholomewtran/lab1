5.22 Financial application: loan amortization schedule

    The monthly payment for a given loan pays the principal and the interest.
    The monthly interest is computed by multiplying the monthly interest rate and the
    balance (the remaining principal). The principal paid for the month is therefore
    the monthly payment minus the monthly interest.

    Write a program that lets the user enter the loan amount, number of years, and
    interest rate and displays the amortization schedule for the loan.

    Find:
    - Monthly Payment
    - Total Payment

6.22 Math: Approximate the square root

    There are several techniques for implementing the sqrt method in the Math class.
    One such technique is known as the Babylonian method. It approximates the
    square root of a number, n, by repeatedly performing a calculation using the following
    formula:

        nextGuess = (lastGuess + n / lastGuess) / 2

    When nextGuess and lastGuess are almost identical, nextGuess is the approximated
    square root. The initial guess can be any positive value (e.g., 1). This value
    will be the starting value for lastGuess. If the difference between nextGuess and
    lastGuess is less than a very small number, such as 0.0001, you can claim that
    nextGuess is the approximated square root of n. If not, nextGuess becomes lastGuess
    and the approximation process continues.

    Implement the following method that returns the square root of n.
